# HTML Cheatsheet

Single-Page HTML Cheatsheet built at CodeAcademy's Front End Engineer code. ðŸŽ‰

It contains Table / Forms / Semantic information, and it's currently a WIP.

## Overview

I believe this could be quite useful in the future for reference, so I plan to keep working on it. Some overall changes planned are:

- Finish the Forms section;
- Create a CSS page;
- Polish the page, fix the grid and make its design consistent.

## Changelog

- 1.0 - Initial commit.
